This folder contains a range of models used in the various derivative prices implemented. These include credit models for valuing portfolio credit products such as CDS Tranches, Monte-Carlo based models of stochastics processes used to value equity, FX and interest rate derivatives, and some generic implementations of models such as a tree based Hull White model. Because the models are useful across a range of products, it is better to factor them out of the product/asset class categorisation as it avoids any unnecessary duplication.
